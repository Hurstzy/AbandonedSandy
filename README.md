# Abandoned Sandy
I created this map a while ago to solve our issue with players clustering in Sandy Shores. I have since removed the map from my server as it is no longer an issue. I am now releasing it to help others that may have the same issue we had. This is a very simple resource that includes the map and a client script that clears peds, cars, ect. within the area of the map. The install instructions are below. If you need even more support comment on the thread or join my support discord - https://discord.gg/YTjgqaPHXh. Finally please do not re-release this without explicit permission from me.

# Installation
Download the resource
<br>
Move AbandonedSandy to your resources folder
<br>
Add "start AbandonedSandy" to your server.cfg

# Disclaimer
To clear up any confusion I based this map off of a previous abandoned sandy shores release, when I went to download the release I had realized it was taken down so I then made my own.
